The Advanced Financial Fraud Detection Model leverages machine learning to detect and prevent fraudulent transactions. By analyzing historical financial data, transaction patterns, and user behavior, it classifies transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent. The system employs both supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms, enabling it to adapt dynamically to emerging fraud trends. A real-time dashboard with interactive visualizations allows users to monitor risks, analyze transaction trends, and make data-driven decisions. Key features include real-time transaction monitoring, behavioral pattern analysis, and predictive insights from historical data. Additionally, customizable fraud detection rules make the system scalable for enterprise-level applications. Developed using Python with libraries such as Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Flask, this model enhances fraud detection efficiency while reducing financial risks. With its robust analytics and real-time alert system, it serves as a vital tool for financial institutions and businesses seeking to strengthen their security framework.
